# SUPER HERO APP

## Theme and Purpose
The theme of this app is to show all the heroes in the api.\
We were trying to create a card game where you fight off a computer who selects a random card to face against you.\
Unfortunately, we ran into a problem loading all the superheroes and spent a long time fixing it.
